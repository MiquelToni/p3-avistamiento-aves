  <text_field rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">it seemed odd that the falcon didn't remain on its prey, so i am assuming that it was startled by my human presence mere feet from its attack. i retreated down to the water's edge to presumably watch the 'grin return for its meal. the falcon seemed noncommittal though. it made a couple passes near the gull but for whatever reason refused to finish the job; she eventually flew off as the flightless gull scampered to the water and swam away. it could be that i lingered too close, but more likely it was the human activity on the beach and the sidewalk, closer to the bird than i was, that spooked it. hopefully the gull became a meal sooner than later, as it had no hope of flying again. i have been back there twice since then and have not seen any broken-winged gulls, so here's hoping its end came rather quickly. nature is brutal but endlessly fascinating.

  <text_field rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">yesterday afternoon (5 feb 2022) was cold and blustery, but the sun was shining and i was itching to use my new canon r5 for the first time. so i went down to the west haven boat ramp to try shooting gulls from the car. this site is reliable for close views of gulls without having to brave the elements, and the afternoon sun would be at my back. a first cycle iceland gull was on site for a bit. otherwise i practiced with the new camera and experimented with different settings, particularly different autofocus modes. at one point a distant brant flock took flight across the harbor and i took the opportunity to shoot a few artsy (and i use that word very loosely) photos of the flock with east rock park in the background. while sorting through the images that evening i picked out a "black" brant that happened to be perfectly lit and positioned for an identifiable photo. it's better to be lucky than good!

  <text_field rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">i hadn't given a new circle much thought until october 16, 2019. i was scanning the great island marsh in old lyme from the observation deck in hopes of adding american bittern to my self found big year total. waiting for three hours for a bittern to flush during that rising tide gave me plenty of time to soak up the location. migration conditions that midday were decent, and a light hawk flight had developed. several sparrows were kicking around the hedges. shorebirds were flying around the marsh as the tide rose. gulls and terns were feeding at the river mouth. i had only tallied 41 species over those three hours, but it seemed that this spot held great big sit potential.

"viz-mig" (visible migration) is another interest of mine, one that is best observed with a view of the sky. in fact, migration in general i find endlessly fascinating and exciting. i would honestly much rather look at long-distance migrant shorebirds on a mudflat than some resident range-restricted endemic elaenia in a forest.

  <text_field rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">the purple-crowned lorikeet is a common bird in the murray bridge district of south australia where i live. on most occasions, however, i hear them go screeching overhead at speed and rarely get good views of them like in todays photos. sometimes i am lucky enough to see them reasonably close when they land to feed on the blossoms of one of the mallee trees on my land. that is when my binoculars help out, as well as the 83x zoom on my camera.
